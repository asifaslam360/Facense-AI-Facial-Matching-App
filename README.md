This project is a Facial Matching System built using Streamlit, DeepFace, and OpenCV. It allows users to upload a target image and compare it with a set of images in a folder to identify matches. The system highlights the matched image and provides a user-friendly interface,i've created this app as my semester project for my university.

# Features:
Upload an image of a person for matching.
Upload a folder of images to compare against.
Uses AI-powered DeepFace to perform face detection and recognition.
Displays the uploaded image and the matched image side by side.
Progress spinner to indicate processing.
Professional and visually appealing interface with custom HTML and CSS.

# Technologies Used:
Python 3.8+
Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
DeepFace: For face detection and recognition.
OpenCV: For image processing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pillow: For image handling.

# Setup and Installation:
I'll recommend you to create an separate virtual environment for this app to avoid possible dependencies conflicts 
& setup, install dependencies (Use anaconda's conda package manager)
## 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/asifaslam360/Facense-AI-Facial-Matching-App.git
cd  Facense-AI-Facial-Matching-App
## 2. Install Dependencies:
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 is required to run this project. Please install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.(Project works fine with python 3.8)
Then, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## 3. Run the Application:
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
streamlit run facense.py

# Usage Instructions:
1. Launch the app using the above command.
2. Upload a target image on the left column.
3. Upload or select a folder of images on the right column.
4. Click Start Matching to begin the process.
  The app will display:
. The target image in the left image box.
. The matched image (if found) in the right image box.
Note:I've uploaded some images in my repository , you can use that test data to test the app's working.
